## Hi there 👋 I’m Arav

I’m an EECS student at Harvard focused on **robotics** — especially projects where **real hardware, perception, and learning** come together through fast iteration.

- 🤖 **Robotics focus:** robot learning + autonomy, perception-driven control, and end-to-end prototyping
- 🔧 **What I build:** rapid prototypes (CAD → fabrication → electronics → control/software), robot learning experiments, and computer-vision demos
- 🦾 **Current work:** low-cost human augmentation (universal-fit prosthetic socket), microrobotics tooling, and reinforcement learning projects
- 🌱 **Learning right now:** robot learning + perception, better evaluation/benchmarking, and turning prototypes into reliable systems
- 💬 **Ask me about:** prototyping workflows, CAD/3D printing/PCBs, RL basics, and building scrappy research rigs
- 📫 **Reach me:** abhargava@college.harvard.edu • www.linkedin.com/in/arav-bhargava • www.aravsportfolio.com

Pinned below are a few projects I’m most excited about — more coming soon.
