## Hi there 👋 I’m Arav

I’m an EECS student at Harvard who builds at the intersection of **robotics, prototyping, and applied ML** — I like projects where code meets real hardware and iteration.

- 🔧 **What I build:** rapid prototypes (CAD → fabrication → electronics → control/software), robot learning experiments, and computer-vision + autonomy demos  
- 🦾 **Current focus:** low-cost human augmentation (universal-fit prosthetic socket work), microrobotics tooling, and reinforcement learning projects  
- 🌱 **Learning right now:** robot learning + perception, better evaluation/benchmarking, and turning prototypes into reliable systems  
- 🤝 **Open to:** collaborators who ship, test in the real world, and care about strong engineering fundamentals  
- 💬 **Ask me about:** prototyping workflows, CAD/3D printing/PCBs, RL basics, and building scrappy research rigs  
- 📫 **Reach me:** abhargava@college.harvard.edu • www.linkedin.com/in/arav-bhargava • www.aravsportfolio.com

Pinned below are a few projects I’m most excited about — more coming soon.
